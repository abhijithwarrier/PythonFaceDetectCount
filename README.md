# PythonFaceDetectCount
PYTHON GUI TO DETECT AND COUNT NUMBER OF FACES IN AN IMAGE USING OpenCV LIBRARY

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV-Python makes use of Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib.

### The module can be installed using the command - pip install opencv-python
